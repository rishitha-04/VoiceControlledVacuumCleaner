Voice Controlled Vacuum Cleaner Robot

A smart Arduino-based robotic vacuum cleaner that can be controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth voice commands or Bluetooth app button controls. The robot uses four DC motors for movement and can respond to directional commands such as forward, backward, left, right, and stop using a mobile phone.


ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ”Š **Voice control** via Bluetooth using mobile apps  
- ðŸŽ® **App-based remote control** (using arrow/button commands)  
- âš¡ Powered by **Arduino Uno + Adafruit Motor Shield**  
- ðŸ”„ Supports movement in all directions (forward, backward, left, right)  
- ðŸ§¹ Can be attached to a vacuum suction motor
